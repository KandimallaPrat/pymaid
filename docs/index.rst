Pymaid is a Python library for **visualisation** and **analysis** of **neuron data**
generated with `CATMAID <http://catmaid.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_. It allows you to
fetch, analyse and plot neuron morpholgy and connectivity from a CATMAID server.

The package is stable but I recommend watching its
`Github repository <https://github.com/schlegelp/PyMaid>`_ for updates.
Make sure that your ``pymaid.__version__`` is up-to-date and check out the
:ref:`release notes <whats_new>`.

For a brief introduction to the library, you can read the
:ref:`tutorial <tutorial>`. Visit the
:ref:`installation page <installing>` page to see how to download the
package. You can browse the :ref:`example gallery <example_gallery>` and
:ref:`API reference <api>` to see what you can do with pymaid.

Pymaid is licensed under the GNU GPL v3+ license. The source code is hosted
at `Github <https://github.com/schlegelp/PyMaid>`_. Feedback, feature requests
and bug reports are very welcome and best placed in
`issues <https://github.com/schlegelp/PyMaid/issues>`_.
